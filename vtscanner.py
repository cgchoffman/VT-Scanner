""" Uses the virustotal package (https://github.com/Gawen/virustotal) to
interact with the VirusTotal API.

Takes a Komodo MSI installer as an arguement, breaks the installer into smaller,
VirusTotal bite sized pieces (zip files), then sends them to VirusTotal to be
scanned and waits for the reports to be ready and retrieves them.  It will print
out either:

Report for batch-5-IDE-8.5.3-83203.zip received!
    ***NO VIRUSES DETECTED***
    
OR

Positive report detected for batch-5-IDE-8.5.3-83203.zip.  Queuing for print...

Example start command:

 > python vtscanner.py Komodo-IDE-x.y.z-xxxxx.msi

Then will log.info(out the resulting malicious reports.

No human interaction is necessary other than starting it.

***Must include a config.json file containing a valid APIKEY***
Ex. format:
{
    "APIKEY": "b987a09c0983002309823e0-thisIsFake-9809887087a097987b9870987098"
}

Special case exit for this script is sys.exit(2) which means a virus was detect.
